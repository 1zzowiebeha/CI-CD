# Actionable

Fix the `asset-*` commands.
    * Use another library. Or maybe it's a problem with the glob pattern.

Implement the `asset:generate-pictures` command.
    * Or just use Webpack
    
✅ Implement `browser:serve` command.
    * Download its dependency

# Research
  
Read eslint documentation and review the `js:eslint` command.

Read the Sass documentation about comments to learn about comments in .css output.

Read the Browser Sync documentation.

Read node's CLI & package[-lock].json documentation.

Research PostCSS, and possibly switch to it:
    It will provide CSS tree-shaking [?]
    It offers experimental feature polyfills [?] (are there caveats?)
    It offers native linting [?]

Use WebPack or Vite:
    ⭐ * It will let us use something like `copy-webpack-plugin`
        .. to migrate away from the abandoned `copyfiles` + `onchange` packages, and related asset copy/watch plugins.
        These plugins are very limited, for example the inability to copy descendant dir structure and not include the parent dir structure. So we are limited to a flat file structure with our output.
        (this could be my lack of globbing knowledge.)
        (with "src/assets/\*\*/\*" as an input path, the input path's root structure is copied (src/assets/\*\*/\*) instead of input dir's descendants (assets/\*\*/\*)).
    * Also the plugins mentioned above don't track file deletions :(
    * Concurrent sass watch + browser-sync doesn't work with background operator. (why?) concurrently needed?
    * It will give us JS tree-shaking powers. (why choose this over Rollup [?])
    ⭐ * It will let us run terser recursively instead of on one file
        ^ (can't use terser-folder since it is abandoned).
    * It will let us generate downscaled DPI images (and replace them in the HTML [?]).
    
Understand what strict mode is in regards to terser.

Fix current lack of terser variable substitution & deletion.
    (ex.
        if a const is defined and used only once.
        in that case, the declaration should be removed and its value plugged into where it is used.
    )
    
    * Welp. It looks like it resolved itself. Which flag did it?
