Implement asset:generate-pictures command
    Or just use Webpack
    
Implement browser:serve command
    
Read eslint documentation and review the js:eslint command.

Read the Sass documentation about comments to learn about comments in .css output

Research PostCSS, and possibly switch to it:
    It will provide CSS tree-shaking [?]
    It offers experimental feature polyfills [?] (are there caveats?)
    It offers native linting [?]

Use WebPack or Vite:
    * It will let us use something like copy-webpack-plugin
        .. to migrate away from the abandoned `copy-and-watch` plugin.
    * It will give us JS tree-shaking powers.
    * It will let us run terser recursively instead of on one file
        ^ (can't use terser-folder since it is abandoned).
    * It will let us generate downscaled DPI images (and replace them in the HTML [?]).
    
Understand what strict mode is in regards to terser

Fix current lack of terser variable substitution & deletion
    (ex.
        if a const is defined and used only once.
        in that case, the declaration should be removed and its value plugged into where it is used.
    )
