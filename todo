Switch from SCSS to PostCSS:
    It will provide CSS tree-shaking
    It offers experimental feature polyfills?
    It offers native linting
    
Remove all comments from CSS output, even /* */

asset:generate-pictures
    Or just use Webpack

Use WebPack or Vite:
    * It will give us JS tree-shaking powers.
    * It will let us run terser recursively instead of on one file.
    * It will let us generate downscaled DPI images (and replace them in the HTML?).
    
Understand what strict mode is in regards to terser

Fix current lack of terser variable substitution & deletion (ex. if a const is defined and used once. the declaration should be removed and its value plugged into where it is used.)
